Considering that my team will use a non-uniform, segmented pricing strategy to price your team's solution idea, following are my ideas for each point:

 

1. price metric(s) : 

a. Number of Program Administrators

b. No. of departments

c. No. of courses to be scheduled

d. No. of instructors

 

2. pricing structure:

a. Which items will be charged to the customer? 

    - Hosting the server

    - Solution Integration fee

    - Application training fee (Content/ resources required to train Program Administrators and instructors)

b, How often will the price be charged?

    - Monthly (Based on the courses/ departments/ Program Administrators involved each month)

c. When will the payments be required? 

     - Yearly (Will be a hassle for the university/ department to make frequent payments)

d. Who will pay for the product?

    - Will be paid for by the department or university.

 

3. reference price:

a. $10/user (monday.com, a productivity and efficiency tool used by organizations charges $10 per user for its standard package. Since we aim to achieve the same with our tool, this will be our reference solution)
